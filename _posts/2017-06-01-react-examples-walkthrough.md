I have commented a handful of examples taken from React's documentation. These examples cover the very basics of React: JSX, props, state and lifecycle. 

## Set Up

I've embedded a JSFiddle below for you to try out the examples and see them for yourself, without any of the set-up. 
It's already hooked up with React, ReactDOM and a container div to render your apps!
